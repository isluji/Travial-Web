########## INSTALL DOCKER COMPOSE

# For this project, we will also need Docker Compose, a tool for defining
# and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, we configure
# our app's services in a file and the create and start them with a single command.

# Install Docker Compose with curl
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.9.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Apply executable permissions to the binary
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Test the installation
sudo docker-compose --version
